*CoVim.txt*  A plugin that brings collaborative editing inside vim.
                Author: FredKSchott

CoVim provides an easy way to define a vim instance as a server where your
collaborators can join you and edit the file at the same time.

Each collaborator gets a cursor of a different color and can be at different
places in the file being edited.
Every collaborator sees the change of the other in real time.
